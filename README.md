# Is the user currently working?

Check if the user is currently working on a Mac

## How to use

server side:

1. change directory to `server`
2. copy `config_example.json` to `config.json`, and edit it by yourself.
3. using `go run server.go` to start server.

client side:

1. change directory to `client`
2. using `go run client.go` to start client in your mac.

Only Mac OS is supported now. You can update `client.go` to support other OS.
